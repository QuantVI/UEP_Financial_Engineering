*The testing phase of this report grew quickly. There were too many directions to explore wih regard to architecutre. As such, some options had to be held constant. The pdf is a high level summary of the 70+ page write-up, and a lot of coding/design do-overs.*

#### Selected Properties of Artificial Neural Networks in Application to Prediction of an Equity Price Index

see pages 9 and 10 of the pdf for the higleghted set of results

### In this Repo
In terms of the programming effort, there were 5 major stages in this process.  In between the major stages, a lot of exploration and testing was done via Jupyter or smaller scripts.

#### Stages
- a. Learning Keras, basic MLP design, etc
- b. MLP : Choosing the network size
- c. MLP : Various results to dtermine th ebest architecture
- d. MLP : Testing variations on Activation funtionc and Learnign Optimizers
- e. LSTM: Build and Test for different Learning Optimizations

Many interim notebooks and scripts are not included. However, the main items are included, and prefixed with the Stage letter.
