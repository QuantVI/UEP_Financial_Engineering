*It was extremely fun designing this product. I took a cue from the naming conventions of options and other products on the market. For example, "Mountain Range" options. The naming is chosen to be marketable, not necessarily based on the instrument itself.*

*It most courses, we would do simulations with 100 to 5000 iterations on simple paths. I wanted my pricing to be more precise, and thus ran multiple 40K iterations on complex paths with 2000 or more steps.*

#### Project - Structured Product

###### A structured product, (aka a market-linked investment), is a pre-packaged, structured financial investment strategy; based on a single security, a basket of securities, options, indices, commodities, debt issuance or foreign currencies, and to a lesser extent, derivatives.

I. Prepare technical documentation about a designed structured product. Contents shoudl include:

- Information about securities used in your product
  -  Use at least two instruments, one being an exotic option
  -  Or design your own, and get approval before beginning.
- Payoff formula
  - Examples of payoff for different market circumstances (Scenario analysis).
- Valuation of the designed product
  - **My product did not have a simple closed-form solution.**
  - **Thus pricing via simulation was a necessity.**
- Sensitivity analysis
  - How change of market risk factors affect price of the option.


II. Presentations about your designed structured product will be given in class.
