_Many MFE programs are about refinement. Accepted student have a majority of the knowledge and background, and just learn to put a new perspective on things they've done many times before._

_The program at the University of Economics, Poznan was different! Students had varying levels or pre-requisities, and the program was designed to build intuation and ability from scratch. Looking back a old notes, test, reports, and projects, I can see this progression in myself and my fellow students._
